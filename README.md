# math2211-spring-2022
This is my repository of problem sets, exams, and other notes I created when teaching MATH2211 Honors Linear Algebra in Boston College, in Spring 2022. I used Axler's _Linear Algebra Done Right_ and William Keane's in-house course notes (not included). Some nice problems in here. Check out the final exam in particular.
